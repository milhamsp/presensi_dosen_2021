This repository contains my Thesis project which is  Web-based Application called "Pengembangan Aplikasi Monitoring Kehadiran Dosen Pada Lingkungan Universitas Gunadarma Berbasis Website". This project has been finished in September 2021 and I am the one who created it with the help of my Lecturer as System Analyst.
This Web-based application was created to accomplish my Final Project (Skripsi) project using PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript with MySQL as its DBMS and supported by CodeIgniter 3 PHP framework and Bootstrap 4.0 CSS framework. It implements the auto-populate and autocomplete feature for easy data entry using the AJAX engine and JQuery UI. This research is aimed at developing a website-based attendance application that can overcome the defect of the lecturer attendance system through Google Form and assist the monitoring department of Gunadarma University lecturers in processing the attendance data into the required report form.
